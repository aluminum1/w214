    <statement>

        Show that the list of vectors
        <m>(2, \, 3, \, 1)</m>, <m>(1, \, -1, \, 2)</m>,
        <m>(7, \, 3, \, c)</m> is linearly dependent in
        <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> if and only if <m>c=8</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        The list of vectors in <m>\Mat_{2,2}</m> given by
        <md>
          \ve{v}_1 = \cmatrix{1 \amp  2 \\ 1 \amp  1}, \, \ve{v}_2 = \cmatrix{0 \amp  1 \\ -2 \amp  1}, \, \ve{v}_3 = \cmatrix{1 \amp  0 \\ 2 \amp  3}, \, \ve{v}_4 = \cmatrix{0 \amp  3 \\ 1 \amp  -1}, \, \ve{v}_5 = \cmatrix{1 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1}
        </md>
        is linearly independent
        (you will prove this in <xref ref="checking_matrices_lin_dep">Exercise</xref>,
        but for the sake of this question you may assume it to be true).
        Go through the same steps as in <xref ref="app_of_prop_preceding">Example</xref>
        to find the first vector in the list which is either the zero vector or a linear combination of the preceding vectors.
