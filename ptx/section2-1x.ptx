        Prove that set <m>A</m> from <xref ref="Ch1Sec1Intro">Section</xref>
        together with the addition operation <xref ref="add_in_A" />,
        the zero vector <xref ref="zero_in_A" /> and the scalar multiplication operation <xref ref="sm_in_A"/> forms a vector space.

        together with the addition operation <xref ref="add_in_C"/>,
        the zero vector <xref ref="zero_in_C" /> and the scalar multiplication operation <xref ref="sm_in_C" /> forms a vector space.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Define the set <m>C^\prime</m> consisting of all polynomials of degree <em>exactly </em> 4. Show that if <m>C^\prime</m> is given the addition operation <xref ref="add_in_C"/>, the zero vector <xref ref="zero_in_C" /> and the scalar multiplication operation <xref ref="sm_in_C" /> then <m>C^\prime</m> <em> does not </em> form a vector space.
