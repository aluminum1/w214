<p>Let us mention a few features that the sets do <em class="emphasis">not</em> have, or at least do not have in common.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Set \(A = \mathbb{R}^2\) has a <em class="emphasis">multiplication operation</em>. Because we can think of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) as the complex plane \(\mathbb{C}\text{,}\) and we know how to multiply complex numbers. There is no clear choice of a multiplication operation on \(B\text{.}\) The same for \(C\text{:}\) if you try to multiply two degree \(4\) polynomials in \(C\) together, you will get out a polynomial of degree \(8\text{,}\) which does not live in \(C\text{!}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>There is a <em class="emphasis">‘take the derivative’</em> operation on \(C\text{,}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\ve{c} \mapsto \frac{d}{dx} \ve{c}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which we will meet again later. Note that taking the derivative decreases the degree of a polynomial by 1, so the result remains in \(C\text{,}\) and so this is a well defined map from \(C\) to \(C\text{.}\) There is no analogue of this operation in \(A\) and \(B\text{.}\) <article class="assemblage-like"><p>Note that there is no <em class="emphasis">integration</em> map from \(C\) to \(C\text{,}\) because integrating a polynomial <em class="emphasis">increases</em> the degree by \(1\text{,}\) so the result might be a polynomial of degree \(5\text{,}\) which does not live in \(C\text{!}\)</p></article></p>
