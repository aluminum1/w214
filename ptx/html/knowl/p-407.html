<p>This process must eventually terminate. That is, there must exist some \(k \geq 1\) such that \(\basis{B}_k = \left\{ \ve{e}_1, \ldots, \ve{e}_k \right\}\) spans \(W\text{,}\) and hence is a basis for \(W\text{.}\) This is because each list \(\basis{B}_i\) is linearly independent (by construction, no vector is a linear combination of the preceding vectors). And it is impossible to construct a linearly independent list of vectors in \(W\) (and hence in \(V\)) which has more than \(n\) elements, by the Bumping Off Proposition. This also shows that \(k \leq n\text{.}\)</p>
