<p>Let \(n = \Dim(V)\text{.}\) If \(W = \{ \ve{0} \}\text{,}\) then the statement is clearly true. Suppose \(W \neq \{ \ve{0} \}\text{.}\) Choose a nonzero vector \(\ve{e}_1 \in W\) and form the list \(\basis{B}_1 = \left\{ \ve{e}_1 \right\}\text{.}\) If it spans \(W\text{,}\) then we are done. If not, there exists \(\ve{e}_2 \in W\) which is not a scalar multiple of \(\ve{e}_1\text{.}\) Now consider the list \(\basis{B}_2 = \left\{ \ve{e}_1, \ve{e}_2 \right\}\text{.}\) If it spans \(W\text{,}\) we are done. If not, there exists a vector \(\ve{e}_3 \in W\) which is not a linear combination of \(\ve{e}_1\) and \(\ve{e}_2\text{.}\) Consider the new list \(\basis{B}_3 = \left\{ \ve{e}_1, \ve{e}_2, \ve{e}_3 \right\}\text{.}\) And so on.</p>
<p>This process must eventually terminate. That is, there must exist some \(k \geq 1\) such that \(\basis{B}_k = \left\{ \ve{e}_1, \ldots, \ve{e}_k \right\}\) spans \(W\text{,}\) and hence is a basis for \(W\text{.}\) This is because each list \(\basis{B}_i\) is linearly independent (by construction, no vector is a linear combination of the preceding vectors). And it is impossible to construct a linearly independent list of vectors in \(W\) (and hence in \(V\)) which has more than \(n\) elements, by the Bumping Off Proposition. This also shows that \(k \leq n\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Ch2Sec3BasisDimension.html#proof-10">in-context</a></span>
