<p>You should not be scared by <em class="emphasis">abstraction</em>. It simply means getting rid of extraneous detail and limiting oneself exclusively to the most important features of a problem. This allows you to understand the problem better. There are less things to worry about! Moreover, if you encounter another problem, which is superficially different but shares the same important features as the original problem, then you could understand it in the same way. This is the power of abstraction.</p>
