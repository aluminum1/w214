<li>We omit the check that \(V \) is a subspace of \(\Poly_2 \) since it is routine. Let us now construct a basis for \(V \text{.}\) Begin with a non-zero vector \(\ve v_1 \)  in \(V \text{.}\) We make the most obvious choice, let \(\ve v_1 = x -2 \text{.}\) Next pick any vector  \(\ve v_2 \) in \(V \) not in the span of \(\left \{ \ve v_1 \right\} \text{.}\) An obvious choice is \(\ve v_2 = x(x-2) \text{.}\) Since \(V \) is not all of \(\Poly_2 \text{,}\) we know that \(\dim V \lt 3 \text{.}\) Thus \(\basis B' = \bopen \ve v_1, \ve v_2 \bclose\) is a basis for \(V \) and so \(\dim V = 2 \text{.}\)</li>
<li>Once again, we omit the check that \(V \) is a subspace of \(\Poly_2 \text{.}\) Pick any non-zero vector \(\ve v_1 \) in \(V \text{.}\) Let's choose \(\ve v_1 = x \text{.}\) It is not as obvious as before whether there are indeed any vectors in \(V \) not in the span of \(\left\{ \ve v_1 \right\} \text{,}\) and so we must do some computations. If \(p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\) is in \(V \text{,}\) \(p(x)\) must satisfy<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x(2ax + b) = ax^2 + bx + c \\
\implies 2ax^2 + bx = ax^2 + bx + c.
\end{equation*}
</div>Hence \(a  = c = 0 \text{.}\) Thus all vectors in \(V \) are scalar multiples of \(\ve v_1 = x \text{.}\) Hence \(\bopen \ve v_1 \bclose \) is a basis for \(V \) and so \(\dim V = 1\text{.}\)</li>
